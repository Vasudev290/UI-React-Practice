1. What is useEffect?
useEffect is a React Hook that allows you to perform side effects in functional components. Side effects include:
✅ Fetching data from an API
✅ Updating the DOM
✅ Subscribing/unsubscribing to events
✅ Handling timers and intervals

2. Why Use useEffect?
Before React Hooks, we handled side effects in class components using lifecycle methods:

componentDidMount → Runs once when the component mounts.
componentDidUpdate → Runs after every update.
componentWillUnmount → Runs before the component unmounts.

useEffect combines all of these functionalities into a single function inside functional components.


useEffect Syntax;
useEffect(() => {
  // Side effect logic here
}, [dependencies]); 

*The callback function runs when the component mounts or when dependencies change.
*The dependencies array controls how often the effect runs.
