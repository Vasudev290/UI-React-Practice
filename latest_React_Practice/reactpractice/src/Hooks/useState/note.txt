1. What is useState Hook?
The useState hook is one of the most commonly used hooks in React. 
It allows functional components to have state, which was previously only possible with class components.

2. Why Use useState?
Before React Hooks, state management was only possible in class-based components using this.state and setState(). 
The useState hook provides an easier and more efficient way to manage state in functional components.


The syntax:
const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);
