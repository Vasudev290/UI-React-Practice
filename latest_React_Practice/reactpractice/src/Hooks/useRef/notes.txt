ğŸ“Œ 1. What is useRef?
useRef is a React Hook that creates a mutable object (ref) which persists across renders without causing a re-render.
It returns an object: { current: initialValue } where current holds the current value.

const ref = useRef(initialValue);
console.log(ref.current); // Accessing the current value

ğŸ“Œ 2. Why Use useRef?
âœ… Avoid unnecessary re-renders (unlike useState).
âœ… Access and modify DOM elements directly.
âœ… Store previous values without triggering re-rendering.


ğŸ“Œ 3. When to Use useRef?
ğŸ”¹ When storing values that should not trigger re-renders.
ğŸ”¹ When accessing and modifying DOM elements directly.
ğŸ”¹ When keeping a reference to previous values (e.g., previous state).
ğŸ”¹ When handling timers and intervals (like stopwatches).
