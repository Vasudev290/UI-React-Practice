1️⃣ Understanding Props in React ;
What are Props?
Props (short for "properties") are used to pass data from one component to another in React.
Props are read-only and immutable (cannot be modified inside the receiving component).
Why Use Props?
✅ Helps in reusing components.
✅ Allows data flow from parent to child components.
✅ Used for customization of child components.


2️⃣ What is Props Drilling?
Problem with Passing Props
✅ Props work well in small applications.
❌ In a large React app, passing props through multiple nested components becomes a problem (called "props drilling").

🛠 Problem with this Approach:

*The name prop is unnecessarily passed from App → Parent → Child → GrandChild.
*If more components are added, prop drilling gets worse.


3️⃣ How to Solve Props Drilling?
Methods to Solve Props Drilling
✅ Context API (useContext) → Best for simple state management.
✅ Redux → Best for global state management in large applications.


4️⃣ What is Context API in React?
🔹 Context API = "Global State for Components"
✅ Avoids props drilling by allowing direct state access.
✅ Provides a centralized state that any component can access.
✅ Works like a mini Redux store, but is simpler.
